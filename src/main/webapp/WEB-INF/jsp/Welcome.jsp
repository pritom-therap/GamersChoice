<h2>Hello Gamers!</h2>
<br>

<div class="post">
    <div class="entry">
        The gaming industry is a burgeoning and rapidly changing one, multitudes of video games are being released
        every month. As a result, it is difficult for gamers to make correct purchasing choices. The average age
        demographic of gamers is within 12-35 years. Therefore most of them have only a limited amount of money to
        spend on purchase of games. Also often these persons have only a limited amount of time to actually play the
        game because of them being either students or fresh job holders. So it is important for them make correct
        choice of games according to their preferences and available time.
        <br>

        Although a lot of professional video game websites are available which provide in depth information and critic
        reviews, they often fail to address certain issues. A major issue is that in their reviews they do not address
        the varying tastes of different gamers. Even though a game may receive favorable reviews according to the
        criticsâ€™ criteria, it may not be for everyone. There are several such examples. For instance, currently there
        are many games which emphasize a long, sprawling storyline that requires over 30 hours of gameplay. Such games
        are often praised by critics for their storytelling and presentation. Hence, from critic reviews, a gamer will
        be persuaded to buy such games. However, it is often the case that he may only have limited amount to devote
        to gaming. As a result, he will find the game to be slow-moving and will end up regretting his purchase.
        <br>

        This website aims to address these concerns. We realise that a game should only be recommended to a gamer if it
        matches his/her own preferences or if it receives favorable reviews from other like-minded gamers. So, we
        have created a website in which users will receive suggestions of video games according to their personal
        preferences.
